"""Composes the EFFECTIVE spec for the behave run: openspec/specs (source of
truth) with every active change's delta applied -- i.e. what openspec/specs
will become once the active changes are synced/archived.

../COMPOSITION.md IS THE DEFINITION -- which version of each requirement runs,
the six-step procedure, the report format and the fail/warn conditions live
there. This file is the behave binding of it;
javascript/openspec-effective-paths.cjs is the cucumber-js binding. Change the
doc first, then both implementations (see the skill's "Port parity" note).

THIS BINDING'S MECHANISM -- AND WHY IT DIFFERS FROM THE JS STACK
---------------------------------------------------------------
A superseded scenario must not reach the runner AND must not show up as
"skipped": a skipped count pollutes the zero-pending completion signal, because
a superseded rule is replaced, not unfinished.

cucumber-js satisfies this with line-targeted paths (`spec.feature:12:19`),
which filter at DISCOVERY time -- the other scenarios are never loaded.

behave's equivalent (`spec.feature:12`) does NOT: it selects at runtime and
reports every unselected scenario as skipped ("2 passed, 1 skipped"). Neither
`show_skipped = false` nor `--no-skipped` suppresses that count; they only
affect printing. So line targeting cannot satisfy the contract here.

Instead this module PRUNES the superseded Rule blocks out of the extracted
tree, blanking their lines in place, and hands behave whole files. That is not
a spec edit: .extracted/ is a generated artifact -- gitignored, wiped and
rebuilt on every run -- so the source of truth stays pristine until sync, which
is what the contract actually protects. Blanking (rather than deleting) lines
keeps the line-fidelity invariant intact, so the surviving scenarios still sit
at their original spec.md line numbers.

Parsing is line-based over the .feature files extract_gherkin.py writes to
.extracted/, whose shape ../EXTRACTION.md defines. A literal "Rule:" starting a
docstring line would be miscounted, but the extractor rejects structure
keywords in fences, so none can exist.

Stdlib only, 3.8+ compatible.
